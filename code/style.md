# Style

Common style over all codebase is essential for shared codebase. Otherwise most time there will be holy war between coworkers about bad and good practices.

## Spaces over tabs

In general spaces give you more control. This is why [experienced programmers prefer spaces](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-tabsspaces).

How many spaces? In most languages you should use 2, except where it is prohibited, or given styleguide states otherwise.

### Exceptions

In some cases you cannot use spaces, as syntax depends on them. The most popular one (and only one in this guide) is `Makefile`. Keep in mind that you should use only tabs there.
